## navi usage
there are a few aliases for navi cause by default it runs with all cheats loaded.
- running `oscp` will run it with only oscp cheats
- running `work` will run it with only work cheats
- running `personal` will run it with only cheats related to functions in this repo
basically if u are doing oscp material type `oscp`, if u forgot how to do something work related type `work`, otherwise just use navi normally
